# Grimoire

> This program is in heavy development so expect hell :)

Grimoire is a cli tool for creating and managing markdown files that can be built into a book.
Basically, another book making program but open-source and moddable.

I'm going to get this project to a decent place before accepting other commits.
Once I'm ready, I'll create a contribution guideline if anyone is interested.

## Todo
- [ ] Basic cli (project name)
- [ ] The Todo list -_-
